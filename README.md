# Level 2 Capstone Project 1

Here I was tasked to create a simple game using React. 

To be able to successfully do this, you needed to consolidate all the concepts I have learned about React, JSX and JavaScript so far.

## Installation: 

Copy the project folder 'capstone-project-l2p1' to your Desktop.

Open the project folder in terminal( or command line). 

Type npm install into your terminal to download the relevant package and it's dependencies.

```terminal
npm install
```

Once this is complete type npm start to start the React app. 

```terminal
npm start
```

The React App should know be accessible and running at 'http://localhost:3000' on your internet browser.

The objective of the game is to find all the matching card pairs.

### How To Play:

Click the "Start Game" button to shuffle and reveal the game.

To begin, click two cards to reveal them.
